Overview

This project is a fully semantic, accessible personal profile web page for Shyamala Kalimuthu.
It demonstrates best practices in HTML and CSS, including semantic elements, accessibility features, and clean code structure.
Contents

    index.html → Main HTML file with semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, footer).
    css/style.css → Stylesheet for layout, navigation, and image presentation.
    images/myphoto.jpeg → Profile photo used in the About Me section.

Features

    Accessibility: Includes alt text for images, aria-label for navigation, and proper link formats (mailto:, tel:).

    Responsive Design: Includes viewport meta tag for mobile compatibility.
    Clean CSS: Readable, modular styles with hover effects.
