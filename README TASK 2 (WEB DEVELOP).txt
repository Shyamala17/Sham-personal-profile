# Profile Page Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental **HTML and CSS concepts** including:
- Linking an external CSS file with `<link>` inside `<head>`.
- Applying **global styles** (font family, background color, text color).
- Using the **CSS box model** (margin, border, padding, content) to space elements visually.
- Styling headers, paragraphs, and lists differently to improve hierarchy and readability.
- Adding temporary borders/backgrounds to visualize spacing.
- Implementing **class-based styling** instead of inline styles for scalability.
- Inspecting and tweaking spacing live using browser developer tools.
- Refactoring repetitive styles into **reusable CSS classes**.

## 📂 Project Structure
project/
├── index.html    # HTML structure of the profile page
└── style.css     # External CSS file with all styles

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use VS Code Live Server).
3. Ensure `style.css` is in the same folder as `index.html` (or update the `<link>` path if inside a `css/` folder).
4. Use browser **Developer Tools (Inspect)** to experiment with margins, padding, and spacing live.

## 🎨 Features
- **Visually structured profile page** with sections: About Me, Skills, Contact.
- **Reusable classes** like `.card`, `.btn-primary`, `.highlight` for consistent styling.
- **Box model visualization**: margins, padding, borders applied to `.card`.
- **Temporary debug mode**: uncomment the last block in `style.css` to see borders and background colors for all elements.

## 🧩 Deliverables
- `index.html` → Profile page structure.
- `style.css` → Styles implementing global rules, box model, hierarchy, and reusable classes.
- Browser output → A clean, visually structured profile page with proper spacing.
